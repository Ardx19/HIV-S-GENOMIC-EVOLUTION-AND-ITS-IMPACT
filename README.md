# HIV Drug Resistance Analysis Pipeline

This bioinformatics pipeline analyzes the **HIV gag-pol region** across geographically diverse strains to identify mutations, assess structural impacts, and correlate them with drug resistance. The project explores how **genomic evolution** affects treatment strategies by integrating sequence alignment, mutation analysis, entropy visualization, structural comparisons, and external drug resistance databases.

*A more detailed report, including figures and interpretative analysis, is available in the included presentation PDF (`Genomic Evolution of HIV and Its Impact Presentation.pdf`) within this repository.*

## üêù Project Overview

Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) evolves rapidly due to high mutation and recombination rates, making treatment and vaccine development highly challenging. This pipeline focuses on:

* **Tracking HIV genomic evolution**
* **Identifying region-specific mutation patterns**
* **Analyzing drug resistance hotspots**
* **Inferring structural and functional consequences of mutations**

We particularly study the **Gag-Pol polyprotein** which plays a vital role in virus replication and is subject to drug-induced selective pressures.

## üåç Geographic Focus

The analysis is conducted using sequences from 5 countries with significant HIV burdens:
**India, Nigeria, South Africa, Brazil, USA**

## üß™ Workflow Summary

1. **Sequence Translation**
   Translates HIV gag-pol nucleotide sequences into proteins.

2. **Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)**
   Aligns all protein sequences to a reference for mutation comparison.

3. **Mutation Detection**
   Finds amino acid mutations and logs them in reportable format.

4. **Entropy and Z-score Analysis**
   Computes site-wise variability to highlight hotspots.

5. **Phylogenetic Analysis**
   Constructs evolutionary trees using MEGA to trace common ancestors.

6. **Structural Modeling & RMSD**
   Visualizes protein 3D structures and compares conformations using PyMOL and AlphaFold predictions.

7. **Drug Resistance Prediction**
   Evaluates mutation impact using tools like SIFT and Stanford HIVDB.

## üìÇ Project Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

-   **`/` (Root)**
    -   `main_pipeline.py`: The main script that executes the core bioinformatics pipeline, from translation to mutation detection.
    -   `plotting.py`: A script dedicated to generating visualizations from the pipeline's results.
    -   `requirements.txt`: Lists all the Python packages required for the project.
    -   `README.md`: This documentation file.
    -   `hiv_sequences.fasta`: An example FASTA file containing HIV nucleotide sequences.

-   **`/gag-pol/`**
    -   Contains the primary input data, with FASTA files of HIV gag-pol sequences for different geographic regions (e.g., `gag-pol_USA.fasta`).

-   **`/output/` & `/translated_proteins/`**
    -   These directories store the pipeline's outputs. `translated_proteins/` holds the amino acid sequences, while `output/` contains alignments, mutation reports, and plots.

-   **`/sift/`**
    -   Used for storing files and results related to SIFT analysis, which predicts the functional impact of amino acid substitutions.

-   **`/DrugResistanceSdb/`**
    -   Holds data and reports related to the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database analysis.

-   **`/pgmol/`**
    -   Contains files for 3D structural analysis, likely including PyMOL (`.pml`, `.pse`) scripts or protein structures (`.pdb`).

## üìä Key Results

* **Entropy peaks** were observed at amino acid regions \~20‚Äì40, 80‚Äì100, 120‚Äì140, and 480‚Äì510, indicating potential mutation hotspots.
* **Phylogenetic analysis** revealed evolutionary closeness between India and Brazil, and between Nigeria and the USA.
* **RMSD values** from PyMOL show structural similarities (low RMSD) and differences (high RMSD) with functional implications for drug resistance.
* **Integrase domain conservation** between India and Brazil suggests shared susceptibility to Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitors (INSTIs).
